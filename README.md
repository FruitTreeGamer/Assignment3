Hacking
This is where someone intends to exploit a weakness in a system with the intent to force their way into the system to find sensitive information like bank details. They will then use this sensitive information for a malicious use. To avoid this companies, need to have good protection against it. For example, anti-virus software which will protect the system from hackers. Hackers can be prosecuted against the computer misuse act 1990 as they do not have permission to access then system.

Identity theft
Identity theft is when someone uses malicious software to gain personal information on a someone, they then use this to steal their identities, they will use this to open things like bank accounts, withdraw money or commit fraud under the stolen name. To prevent identity theft, you could be alert to phishing and spoofing so you do not give your details to someone who you thought was the bank. Shred all the documentation before throwing it in the trash, this is so it is not found in a land fill and used against you. Be wary about public Wi-Fi as its not safe to do shopping, banking, or anything sensitive as hackers can look in on it. If you do use a public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to have a more secure connection. (O'Shea, 2020)
Data protection act 1998/2018
This is used to protect personal data, if a company has a breach and personal data is lost then they can be prosecuted by the data protection act. In 2018 there was a law concerning how data is treated by an organisation which considered the amount of data stored this is called the General Data Protection Regulation, if the company was not storing the data safely, they can also be prosecuted by this law. (BBC, 2018)
To protect data organisations can use Anti- virus software which will make sure that a virus or malware is not leaked into the system and they can train the staff about phishing emails so a staff member does not accidently give someone information they should not have.
The organisations can also have a firewall which prevents anyone from outside of the network from getting in.
Trojan
This acts like a safe file but tries to attack your device when opened, to prevent this you can use malware protection which will detect it and prevent you from downloading or opening the file, if someone tries to affect someone’s computer with Trojan, they can be prosecuted by the computer misuse act 1990.
Worm
This replicates itself and spreads to another computer on the system , to prevent this you can use malware protection this will detect it and prevent it from spreading before it causes any harm to the system, if someone tries to affect someone’s computer with Worms, they can be prosecuted by the computer misuse act 1990.

Factors relating to the client that could affect the performance of a website
User’s choice of device- The website will load faster if the user is on a high end PC compared to a phone or tablet because it has a higher processing speed, more RAM, a larger cache, and a more stable connection to the Wi-Fi.
Hardware specification of the device- The user computer specification may be impacting the performance of a website; their RAM may be overloaded for example they could have software running which takes up most of the computers power so even loading up a website can be really slow.
It can also be down to the cache memory which is memory that is temporarily stored on the computer which are need to make the website run for example, cookies, passwords and other scripts that the website needs to load before the user is able to view the page.
The processor speed will be something that impacts the performance of the website as a faster processor can perform tasks faster which means it’s able to process the website faster.
The browser being used- The browser may be impacting the user’s performance as certain browsers perform better than others, this can be down to which is best suited for internet browsing.
Factors relating to the server that could affect the performance of a website
Web server capacity- as a website is stored on servers it has a limit to how much data it can send and receive at one time, when loading up a website the user’s computer will be sending and receiving information from the web server, with a higher server capacity the server can send and receive more data at one time which will allow for web pages to load up faster.
Available bandwidth- this is the amount of data traffic that can be downloaded from a website per second, this can be impacted if more people are using the web server as users will be capped at the amount of data they can download per second, if there are not many people on the web server then the download speed will be much higher as the download speed will not be capped due to traffic.
Executions to be performed before the page is loaded up- each page has to execute a number of actions before being able to completely display the web page to the user, the more actions that need to be performed the longer it will take until the webpage is completely loaded up, which impacts the performance of the website.
Number of hits- The amount of people on the web page can affect the speed, if lots of people are on the web page then the server can overload and slow down the web pages performance.

Cross browser compatibility

Code that works differently dependent on browser
Older browsers may not support scripts. For example, in the past for internet explorer, JavaScript was turned off by default. To fix this issue an option would be to comment out the scripts, so the code does not try and get executed. However, this is also a client side issue as JavaScript can be turned on through internet explorers setting so another fix would be having a message telling the user that the site uses JavaScript with a link explaining how to turn it on.
Code that works differently dependent on browser

What is causing the issue and how can you implement a fix

Solution to the problem 


Explaining characteristics of the client side scripting language

What nature is JavaScript
JavaScript is an object oriented programming language which interacts with HTML code of a website to add functions such as graphics, advertisements, and more elements.
Objects
This is where you assign a variable to a data type for example var car = “BMW”. It will assign “BMW” to the variable ‘car’ so in future code I will on have to go “my favourite car is the” + car, and it will display “ My favourite car is the BMW”.
Methods
A method is like start and stop; they are actions that can be performed on objects. They are functions stored as object properties.
Event handling
These are actions that react to code, Events can be executed by hovering over a button, by loading in the page, or by clicking a button.
Security issues
A security issue is that a user can get a computer virus by browsing a website (if one has been intentionally put there) This is because all of the scripting is being ran from the user’s device as its client side, which leaves an open opportunity for a computer virus, which leaves sensitive data being taken.
Access methods
To access an object method, you do;
objectName.methodName()
for example 
name = person.fullName();
the fullName property will execute as a function
the fullName() is the method and the person is the object.

Cookies
Cookies help as it allows the web server to identify a user, this saves recurring users to sign in constantly and change their preferences each time.
Browser detection
Browser detection helps as you can make the program change some code depending on the browser. For example, code that works on internet explorer may not work on chrome so using browser detection you can find what browser they are using then make the program use code that works for that browser.
Form input validation
Form input validation helps as it prevents the user from inputting the wrong data and not knowing why the website is not working. This displays a message where the user has gone wrong so they can correct it accordingly.
